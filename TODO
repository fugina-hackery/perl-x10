modify client/server code to be a little more versatile with what can
be sent back & forth

fix X10::Server to not die when it gets too many connects/disconnects
going on at the same time.  I think this has something to do with my EOF
detection on a socket, which seems to be somewhat broken in the module
I'm using...

expand X10::Device module tree to implement specific (X10) module
characteristics

allow macros to deal with EventList too

add fuzz amount in scheduled events
